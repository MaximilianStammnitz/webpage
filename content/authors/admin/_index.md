Hola! I am a Postdoc in [Ben Lehner's lab](https://www.crg.eu/ben_lehner) at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona.

I have recently completed my PhD with [Elizabeth Murchison](https://www.tcg.vet.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. Together with a multidisciplinary team of researchers between England and Australia, my works have supported initiatives to save the Tasmanian devil, world’s largest carnivorous marsupial, from outbreaks of [transmissible tumour diseases](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/human-anti-cancer-drugs-could-help-treat-transmissible-cancers-in-tasmanian-devils). I am also a founder of [PuntSeq](https://www.puntseq.co.uk/) – a citizen science initiative with the aim of monitoring bacterial contamination in freshwaters by portable DNA analysis devices.
