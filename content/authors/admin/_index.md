Max Stammnitz works as a Postdoc Researcher at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona.

He has recently completed his PhD studies with Elizabeth Murchison at the University of Cambridge. Together with a multidisciplinary team of ecologists, cancer geneticists and computer scientists between the UK and Australia, they have taken a leading role in efforts to help save the Tasmanian devil, world’s largest carnivorous marsupial, from outbreaks of two transmissible facial tumour diseases.

Prior to his MPhil and PhD in Cambridge, Max completed his Biology undergraduate training in Germany. He enjoys working at the interface of research and society, and was a founder of “PuntSeq”[https://www.puntseq.co.uk/] – a widely-publicised citizen science and media initiative with the aim of monitoring bacterial contamination in the River Cam by portable DNA sequencing devices.
